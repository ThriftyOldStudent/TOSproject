![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ThriftyOldStudent/TOSproject/main/src/tos.jpeg)

Project TOS is an experimental project to make a public github repo that hosted every basic implementation of web3 components. This is just a public portfolio of the author: [Asvoria Kuan](https://asvoria.github.io/MyCV/), the thrifty old PhD student, where most of her official works unable to be published due to employment contracts. There is no other way to proof her ability, thus, this repo is started.

This repo demonstrate the interaction with ERC721 tokens (BEP-721 in Binance Smart Chain), minted from [BakerySwap](https://www.bakeryswap.org/) and [Featured by Binance](https://www.featured.market/). The function consist of connecting with [Metamask](https://metamask.io/) wallet and then checking the wallet holder for the NFT they carry in their wallet. 

### Possible utility  
This example demonstrate the utitlity of NFT as a form of membership or rights to access something. Even though the webApp does not have any relationship or access to BakerySwap and Featured Market. The NFT owner owns their asset whole and independent!

This repo demonstrate the issuance of ERC20 token (BEP-20 on Binance Smart Chain). Where the solidity smart contract was deployed using [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/) and went through [BSCscan](https://bscscan.com/) mainnet verification.  

Many struggle with the [OpenZeppelin](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin) library. The trick is, flatten the library into single contract! As simple as that.

### Possible utility  
ERC20 token is a very popular ICO tool. I am still learning and explore. I'm a student after all. Let's learn togather!
